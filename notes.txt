to add an image:
under src/assets/images
add a line to images.res: key=imagefile
under src/assets there is a makefile that builds the ts file with compiled infos
about the images and generates also a ts files with export declaration for asc
under src/engine/wasmEngine/wasm/src/asc/


see asconfig.json:

each worker instantiate each wasm module ...passing the global memory + the
other import vars... 

->att on module instance vs import for let module var ? For now we use only one
module (the engine worker module) and all other files are simply imported (with
import in each other), so we avoid problems with multiple modules with different
var referring to the same location in memory (es free list ptr for the worker
alloc, while the shared heap alloc should be ok since var are locked in
memory...?)

wasm mem layout:
reserved by app | module memory (data + heap):  the module part starts from the
memoryBase value in asconfig: since we don't use the data+heap part we set it to
the start value * page size....maybe we don't set it ?

remove these? i don't use the data+heap part so...
    "initialMemory": 10,
    "memoryBase": 4194304,

TODO: !
Since we are directly writing to memory in this example, and there exists a
runtime in AssemblyScript, be sure to take a look at the --memoryBase flag in
the AssemblyScript compiler. See here:

module imports:

// assembly/env.ts
export declare function logInteger(i: i32): void
https://www.assemblyscript.org/concepts.html

Note on init:
A solution is to utilize the --exportStart command line option to force
exporting the start function instead of making it implicit. Then, instantiation
first returns before any code is executed. Note, however, that the exported
start function must always be called first, before any other exports, or
undefined behavior will occur.  #

Width 100% : It will make content width 100%. margin, border, padding will be added to this width and element will overflow if any of these added.
Width auto : It will fit the element in available space including margin, border and padding. space remaining after adjusting margin + padding + border will be available width/ height.
Width 100% + box-sizing: border box : It will also fits the element in available space including border, padding (margin will make it overflow the container).

-how to link another remote:

for ex. from a specific project that wants to link this as another remote:

git remote add base-origin https://github.com/dbusrepo/web-graphics-base.git
gco base-origin/main -> switch to main branch of base proj
gcob base-origin-main -> create a local branch on it
git branch -u base-origin/main  <- set tracking with remote branch
git pull base-origin main (or simply git pull after the prev cmd) <- we pull from the main branch of base proj

similarly if we want to add to this proj another remote from a specifi proj:

git remote add ray-casting-origin https://github.com/dbusrepo/web-ray-casting.git

Add new project derived from base:

git config user.name dbusrepo
git config user.email dbusrepo@gmail.com

git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/dbusrepo/Line-drawing-wasm.git  <- project origin
git remote add origin-graphics-base-wasm https://github.com/dbusrepo/Graphics-base-wasm.git
gfe -> fetch main from base proj: * [new branch]      main -> origin-graphics-base-wasm/main
gco origin-graphics-base-wasm/main
gcob main  <- main branch new project
git push -u origin main <- link to to origin main
gcob base-main <- local base-main branch to track base project main
git config push.default upstream <- to allow pushing to a branch with a different name
now to set the link to the main branch of the base proj:
git branch -u origin-graphics-base-wasm/main <- set the link with this or if aligned:
(git push -u origin-graphics-base-wasm base-main:main <- link it to base proj main branch)
or git branch --set-upstream-to=origin-web-cg-base/main

$ git remote show origin
$ git remote show <other_remote_name>
show the upstream branches for each branch:
$ git branch -vv

to push from for base-main in ray-casting proj to origin-graphics-web/main:
$ git config push.default upstream
$ git branch --set-upstream-to=origin-graphics-web/main

note: to rename a remote:
ex. rename base-graphics remote to origin-base-graphics:
$ git remote rename base-graphics origin-base-graphics

# change remote url:
git remote set-url origin-graphics-web https://github.com/dbusrepo/Graphics-base-wasm.git

check status with:
gbr, ...
git branch -vv
git remote show origin
git remote show origin-graphics-base-wasm

note about timeout in wasm vs js: nano vs milli
https://github.com/WebAssembly/threads/issues/175

Note: when building wasm files with make from src/engine/wasmEngine/wasm dir, the specific
version of asc the version related to the current node version you are using,
which can differ from the version used by the scripts run with npm run start (in
that case the version is the one specified in the package.json). So to check:
$ asc --version
$ which asc
$ nvm use <node version>
$ npm install -g assemblyscript
to remove an older version select the older node version and then:
$ npm ninstall -g assemblyscript
